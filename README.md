# Head-Mounted-Display
This repository showcases 3D models created for an Augmented Reality-based surgical assistance device.

Tools used: 

Autodesk Inventor : For 3D modelling and stress analysis

Abaqus : For stress analysis

The model is housing for circuitry of the surgical assistance device. 
The project involved ideation and 3D momdelling of the optimal design for the HMD considering functionality without compromising aesthetics.

Human factors were considered while making the design. 
Additional components were designed in order to stabalize and optimize the circuitry.

Final design was 3D printed and the cirtuitry assembled.
